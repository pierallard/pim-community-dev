Feature: Set the attribute used as image
  In order to let the user which attribute is the most accurate as the product image
  As an administrator
  I need to be able to set the attribute used as the image

  Background:
    Given the "default" catalog configuration
    And the following attributes:
      | label-en_US | type              | group | code  |
      | Brand       | pim_catalog_text  | other | brand |
      | Image       | pim_catalog_image | other | image |
    And the following family:
      | code | attributes |
      | Bags | brand      |
    And I am logged in as "Peter"

  Scenario: Successfully show default attribute_as_image
    Given I am on the "Bags" family page
    Then I should see the text "No attribute set"

  Scenario: Successfully change attribute_as_image
    Given I am on the "Bags" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I add available attribute Image
    And I visit the "Properties" tab
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Attribute used as image | Image |
    And I save the family
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    When I am on the "Bags" family page
    Then I should see "Image"

  Scenario: Successfully update attribute_as_image on attribute removal
    Given I am on the "Bags" family page
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    And I add available attribute Image
    And I visit the "Properties" tab
    And I fill in the following information:
      | Attribute used as image | Image |
    And I save the family
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    And I visit the "Attributes" tab
    When I remove the "brand" attribute
    And I visit the "Properties" tab
    Then I should see the text "No attribute set"
    And I save the family
    And I should not see the text "There are unsaved changes."
    When I am on the "Bags" family page
    Then I should see the text "No attribute set"
